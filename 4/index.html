			<h2>My Fire</h2>
			<h3>For as long as I can remember, my greatest passion has been video games.</h3>
			<p>
				As a kid, I remember running home from the school bus. If I beat my older brother
				home, I'd get to play games first. That excitement has stuck with me my whole life.
				In fact, a little over a week ago I woke up before the sun rose to pick up L.A. Noire 
				as early as possible on launch day. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I've always been easily immersed in video games which is why
			    I started teaching myself C++ in my early teen years with the intent of 
			    developing video games as a profession. I wanted to share all the excitement and the
			    passion I have for video games with other people. I wanted them to experience games in the
			    same way I had all my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				After finishing high school, I studied computer science at Southern Oregon University. 
				Unfortunately, C++ was not in their curriculum. Unhappy with
				only learning Java, I took the opportunity to begin the web development department
				at my family business: Passey Advertising, Inc. My father had started and ran
				the company for over 20 years by the time I came on board. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It didn't take long for my programming skills to translate to the web- and even less
				time for the department to flourish. Before I knew it, I was leading a small team
				of passionate developers. Also, I was getting the chance to consult and write applications for well-respected
				corporations, start-ups, and mom &amp; pop shops. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite the success, I've always wanted to work in the video game industry. I'm a longtime
				viewer of IGN. I appreciate and respect what IGN does for the gaming industry. I want nothing
				more than to work at such an awesome place with such passionate people in an industry that I love.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hopefully everything I have put together for this challenge shows the passion I have- 
				for the web, video games, and IGN. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Give me a chance. You won't be disappointed.</strong>
