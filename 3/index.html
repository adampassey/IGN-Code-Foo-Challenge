			<h2>63 Moves</h2>
			<h3>The minimum number of moves required for a knight to cover an entire chessboard is 63.</h3>
			<p class="italic">
			    This is assuming the size of the chessboard is a typical 8x8, and the knight
			    must move according to the rules of chess.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Initially, I intended to create a brute force program that would continually try new, slightly varied
			    routes until finding a route that touched every tile in only 63 moves. I shortly realized that the sheer number of route
			    possibilities would complicate things. It may take hours or even days for a brute force program to 
			    solve this kind of puzzle. I wanted to be able to show you (the IGN Code Foo Challenge Judge) that I 
			    could write a program that could logically find a route that could touch every tile in just 63 moves-
			    starting from any tile. The success rate has been averaged at approximately 98%.

			<p>
			    When I first read this challenge, I assumed we were meant to write a "brute force" program that 
			    would attempt to determine the least amount of moves it would take to cover the entire board. But
			    after some preparation, I realized that the sheer number of possibilities was so large that this type
			    of program might take days to successfully determine a route that would touch every tile only once, 
			    and cover the entire board in only 63 moves.
