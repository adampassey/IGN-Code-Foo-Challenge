			<ul class="steps">
				<li>
					<h2>Step One</h2>
					<h3>Determine the dimensions of the Golden Gate Bridge.</h3>
					<p>
						The Golden Gate Bridge is 1.7 mi. long (2.7 km.), or 8,981 ft., and 90 ft. wide. 
					</p>
					<span class="source">

					    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_gate_bridge">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_gate_bridge &raquo;</a>
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Step Two</h2>
					<h3>Determine the diameter of a penny.</h3>
					<p>
						The diameter of a penny is 19.05 mm., or 0.750 in.
					</p>
					<span class="source">

					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Step Three</h2>
					<h3>Drink some whiskey and/or beer.</h3>
					<p>
						Contrary to popular belief, the consumption of alcohol can actually
						stimulate positive thinking traits in the human mind. It has also been
						found that consuming large amounts of alcohol can increase critical thinking skills.
						Drinking whiskey and/or beer at this point will help determine the steps to follow.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Step Four</h2>
					<h3>Determine the most efficient penny "pattern."</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="../resources/img/pennies-grid.png" alt="pennies-grid" width="200" height="176" class="floatingRightImage"/>
						The first pattern that comes to mind is the typical <strong>head-to-toe pattern</strong> where 
						the pennies are stacked in a grid-like manner.
					</p>
					<p class="clearRight">
						<img src="../resources/img/pennies-stagard.png" alt="pennies-stagard" width="200" height="176" class="floatingRightImage" />
						The second pattern that comes to mind is a <strong>staggered pattern</strong> where the pennies
						are shifted to the right a half a penny in width. Although this pattern does sacrifice pennies
						at the edges, it does allow more pennies to be stacked overall. This 
						can easily be seen by counting the full pennies in each image to the right. The staggered
						image has <strong>33</strong> pennies where the typical head-to-toe pattern only has <strong>30</strong>.
					</p> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Step Five</h2>
					<h3>Determine the calculation method.</h3>
					<p>
						Using the staggered pattern, it is more difficult to calculate how many pennies
						fill a specific area. With the head-to-toe pattern, it would only be necessary to calculate
						how many pennies can fill a 1 x 1 ft. square (16 x 16 pennies = 256). Then I would be able
						to easily calculate the total number of pennies using the total area of the bridge
						(8,981 ft. x 90 ft. = 808,290 sq. ft. x 256 pennies / sq. ft. = 206,922,240 pennies).
					</p>
					<p>
						But since I'm a perfectionist and have wanted to get the attention of IGN for a long time,
						that just wasn't good enough for me. I decided that it would be best to calculate how many
						pennies could fit into each "type" of row: the foundational row and the staggered row. 
					</p>
					<p>
						From there I could determine how many "sets" of rows could fit lengthwise across the bridge.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Step Six</h2>
					<h3>Time to calculate.</h3>
					<p>
						With the width of the bridge being an exact 90 ft., it's easy to determine how many pennies
						could fit in the first row. <strong>90 ft. x 12 in. = 1,080 inches wide.</strong> It's
						also convenient that a penny is 0.750 inches in diameter. You divide the total
						width of the bridge by the diameter of a penny to determine how many pennies in length each
						row will be: <strong>1,080 in. / 0.750 in. = 1,440 pennies in the first row.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, the staggered row has a slight indentation on either side- exactly the width of 1 penny.
						So we know that the staggered row will have <strong>1,439 pennies.</strong> Together, these
						two rows will have a total of <strong>2,879 pennies.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						When you use the staggered stacking method, these two rows together become 35.5 mm. in height.
						Using the 1 mm. = 0.0393700787 in. conversion, we can determine the height of these rows in
						inches: <strong>35.5 mm. + 0.0393700787 in. = 1.39763779385 in.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, all we have to do is determine how many of these rows will fit length wise across the
						bridge. The bridge is 8,981 ft. long, which is equivalent to 107,772 inches. So, we can determine
						this by calculating <strong>107,772 in. / 1.39763779385 in. = 77,110.107120905830 "sets" of rows.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll ignore the decimal point here (if it was over .5 we'd be able to fit a half of one "set" of rows).
						This allows us to make the final calculation of <strong>77,110 "sets" of rows x 2,879 pennies per "set" row =
						221,970,900</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You could fit 221,970,900 pennies on the Golden Gate Bridge without any of them overlapping.</strong>
